# InvCripto3-LiCore

In this challenge, security will be a key factor and public-key cryptography will be used to protect WiFi communications between IoT devices and an energy consumption monitoring center. The existence of risks and threats regarding digital data theft is a concern in communication channels that do not have adequate protection measures. For this reason, public-key schemes that work in resource-limited environments will be sought to be implemented.

The main purpose of this project is to ensure secure communication among all the parties involved in the network, including sensors, control center, and auditor. Scalability, source code, and valuable documentation will be shared on platforms such as Github, always taking into account the confidentiality of sensitive data shared by the training partner or generated by the project.

This challenge will be worked on in collaboration with the organization LiCore, which will act as a training partner. The main goal will be to implement public-key cryptography protocols to protect information during data exchanges between sensors in an IoT environment. It will be sought that these exchanges are safe and automated, including information about the state of the sensors and monitoring and energy consumption.

Likewise, protecting the data exchange between the auditor and the control center will be one of the key missions of this project. It will be sought to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the exchanged information. Confidentiality will be achieved by ensuring that only authorized parties have access to the information. Integrity will be ensured by verifying that the data is not modified during the exchange. Authenticity will be achieved by monitoring and identifying each sensor to determine the origin of the data.

It is important to note that data exchanges may include sensitive information, so privacy, confidentiality, and data security are fundamental. In addition, the control center must be able to update the auditor's software within the information exchange scheme being protected, ensuring that the solution is up-to-date and complies with best security practices.

In summary, this project will seek to ensure that information is processed efficiently and securely, allowing users to obtain accurate and reliable results in a reasonable time. In addition, it is expected that the implementation of advanced data processing technologies will allow for greater efficiency in decision-making and an improvement in the quality of services provided to users. Overall, it is expected that this project will have a positive impact on the industry and contribute to innovation in data processing.
